						<div class="about-text">
							The construction process for a basketball court at Trufello Sports typically commences with an initial consultation to explore the client's vision.

They offer customization options for the court's design, including painted lines, logos, and other graphics, as well as additional features like scoreboards, backboard padding, and basketball hoops.
