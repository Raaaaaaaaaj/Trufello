						<h2 class="mb-4">DIMENSIONS OF FOOTBALL TURF BY FIFA</h2>
						<p class="text-center p-3 py-lg-0">The size of a football pitch should be determined by the game's laws. The playing field needs to be rectangular. The touchline's length needs to be longer than the goal line's. The FIFA recommends that professional football fields be <span class="text-success">100-130 yards (90-120 meters)</span> long and <span class="text-success">50-100 yards (45-90 meters)</span> wide for 11-a-side game. Regardless of the overall field size, the penalty area should be <span class="text-success">18 yards (16.45m)</span> from the centre of the goal line, and the penalty spot should be <span class="text-success">12 yards (10.9m)</span> from the goal.</p>

						<h2 class="mb-4">Football Turf Construction:</h2>
						<p> Football turf construction involves base preparation with soil compaction, followed by adding three layers of aggregates. A drainage system is installed, and an industrial framework supports the turf. The surface is graded to ensure proper water flow, and if required, electrical cabling and lighting are installed. Fencing is placed around the pitch, and goal posts are secured. The turf is laid, then filled with silica sand and rubber granules to ensure stability and cushioning. Finally, lines and markings are added to meet FIFA standards. These steps ensure a durable and professional football turf.</p>

						<h2 class="mb-4">How to Maintain a Football Turf:
						</h2>
						<p>To maintain artificial football turf, regular cleaning is essential to remove dirt and debris using a leaf blower or soft brush, followed by pressure washing. Grooming the turf fibers helps improve ball roll and player traction. Regularly replenish sand and rubber infill to maintain cushioning and shock absorption. Promptly repair any tears or uneven areas to prevent further damage. Routine inspections help detect early signs of wear. Avoid using metal studs or heavy equipment on the turf to prevent excessive damage. Following these tips will keep the turf in good condition, ensuring longevity, safety, and optimal performance.</p>
