						<div class="about-text">
							When you were younger, do you recall using a random stick and a plastic rolled ball to play cricket? During those days, there was never a lack of energy to play cricket. It was never important to have poor equipment or uneven terrain. There is little doubt that box cricket developed gifted players on the streets, but what happened to them all?
							<br>
							A type of street cricket prevalent in India and other South Asian countries is known as <span class="text-success"> "Box Cricket." </span> Small alleyways, streets, or other public areas that aren't designated as cricket grounds are usually where it's played. Box cricket is often seen as a more casual and relaxed version of sport cricket, allowing the game to have fewer players than the sport. The rules might change based on the locale and the players.
